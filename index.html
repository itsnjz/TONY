                  Tony and his co-workers did a great job of repairing my fence. Tony
                  gave me an estimate and was right on. I had great communication with
                  Tony as he advised me of when he and his co-workers would arrive.
                  Tony has installed a steel door for me and a pavilion. He has done
                  great work on all three projects. Tony is very knowledgeable and I
                  wouldn’t hesitate to contact him with any project installations that
                  I would need.

                  We had a very specific list and a budget. Tony worked with us and
                  leveraged his experience to provide cost-effective options that met
                  the need at a lower cost. Perfect!
                  <br />
                  As with most jobs, the scope expanded. Tony kept us informed of the
                  costs and how they related to the original estimate. He was able to
                  provide additional scope without exceeding our original budget.
                  <br />
                  Tony the Homestead Helper was on-time, friendly, explained in detail
                  the scope he was providing and not providing, maintained the
                  schedule and finished the job on-time. I would highly recommend Tony
                  for future work.

                  Tony recently did a partial bathroom remodel for us. He tore down
                  the existing tub/shower surround in our main bathroom, which
                  included a window that needed to be removed (so also a little work
                  on the siding of our house.) Tony found a great solution for the
                  surround that I think will last for many years to come that wasn’t
                  really expensive for our modest little house. He also had to patch
                  the ceiling due to water damage.
                  <br /><br />
                  Tony was very easy to work with, made great suggestions to us, and
                  kept us informed each day what was done and when they’d be back. I
                  appreciated that he brought in a plumber for some of the work rather
                  than trying to do something he wasn’t qualified for. He also pointed
                  out a few things in our house that we may want to think about for
                  future projects (including things we would have some else come do,
                  not just future work for himself). We will definitely bring him back
                  for other home improvements!
